# CSR-Graph-BFS
This is a program that calculates:
1) if a path exist between the 2 nodes the user inserts
2) the size of the path in the graph
3) time elapsed in milliseconds 
Because of the BFS, the program finds the sortest path from one node to another

Initially you must download the file: soc-Epinions1.txt to your computer. Next, you must run the file: script.sh. To do that, you have to open a terminal and type chmod u+x script.sh amd then run it with the command: ./script.sh "Give absolute path where .java files are". The script compiles the .java files and produces the .class files. Finally, you will have to insert the absolute path to soc-Epinions1.txt file. Then the java programm runs until you press ctrl-c.
